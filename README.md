## What I Learned

- How to manipulate DOM elements with JavaScript.
- Using async/await and Promises to create timed sequences.
- Handling user input and comparing arrays for game logic.
- Enhancing user experience with CSS animations and effects.

## Favorite Feature

I enjoyed building the logic that prevents the same color from lighting up consecutively to make the game more interesting and fair.
